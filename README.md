A tiny yet familiar Javascript strategy game forked from [krajzeg's compact-conflict](https://github.com/krajzeg/compact-conflict) created for [JS13k 2014](http://js13kgames.com/). 


#### The code

All the magic happens in `jg.js` and `index.html`. 

If you want to build your own minified versions, `build.sh` can hook you up, but it needs the following installed:

* uglifyjs
* htmlminifier

Both are modules on **npm**.
